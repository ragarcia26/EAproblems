The logs requirements weren't too obvious for me and as such, my implementation may be lacking. For instance, regarding the logs.txt 
file, i'm not sure who the requester is, nor do i know what valid entries are allowed when searching by browser. Would the user
simply search for Firefox, or the entire string within the " " ? For valid entries I allowed for a contains rather than an exact,
but if this were the case it wouldn't seem to make much sence to even parse in the first place, just check the whole input. And as for 
requester, I took an assumption that it would be the domain address within the second set of quotes.
